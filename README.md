# Welcome to the repository of the Destination Earth Use Case Energy Systems!

The Destination Earth Use Case Energy Systems is a joint activity of [DLR](https://www.dlr.de/ve/en), [Aarhus University](https://ece.au.dk/en/),
 and the [Renewables Grid Initiative](https://renewables-grid.eu) with the aim to implement a representative Demonstrator for 
 the use of climate information in numerical energy systems models.

This repository is work in progress. More info will follow soon.
