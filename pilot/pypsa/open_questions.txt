Questions to Matthias:

- How to handle:
    - UA02 (appears in NTC's but not in Loads/generation capacities)
    - ITVI
    - PLE0
    - ... buses appearing in NTY and/or National Estimates but which are no bidding zones
- What to do with 'hidden' columns (C:W) in NTC Excel file?
- Where can maintanance profiles be found (for non-renewables)?
- How to derive scenarios for forced outages?
- Which sheets should be used in Climate Data excel? For DE (e.g.) DE01 - DE07 exist,
  but Germany only has one bidding zone (DE00)
- What are poles? How should different number of poles be considered in the modelling?
- How to handle duplicated links in Transfer Capacities.xlsx?
- ROR time series for CH00 look weird?!
- Where can installed charge/discharge capacities and storage sizes for out-of-market (DSR) batteries be found?
  - Methodology, p. 13, sec. 2.2: "The default assumptions for calculating the number of poles,
    in case TSOs did not provide any information, is 1 pole per 400 MW of capacity,
    with a minimum of two poles per line for HVAC interconnections and 1 pole per cable for HVDC ones
- What is the difference between a set of columns (AA -> BB and BB -> AA) both with
  "One Direction" and a set of columns (AA -> BB and BB -> AA) both with "Both Directions"?
