    - ITVI
    - PLE0
    - ... buses appearing in NTY and/or National Estimates but which are no bidding zones
- What to do with 'hidden' columns (C:W) in NTC Excel file?
- Where can maintanance profiles be found (for non-renewables)?
- How to derive scenarios for forced outages?
- Which sheets should be used in Climate Data excel? For DE (e.g.) DE01 - DE07 exist, but Germany only has one bidding zone (DE00)
- What are poles? How should different number of poles be considered in the modelling?

- ROR time series for CH00 look weird?!
